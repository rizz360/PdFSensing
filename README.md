# PdFSensing Alpha
App created for Praxis der Forschung.

The finished app will direct the user to record environmental sounds correctly.
There should be no difference between the audio recorded by a novice and the audio recorded by an expert.
Additional information will be available in the paper - expected time is march-april 2016.

## Current Features
* Recording and play-back of environmental audio
* Capturing of meta data related to position, date, audio-features, ...
* Ensuring the avoidance of commonly occuring mistakes while recording, i.e.:
  * Pose (orientation and position) of user and device
  * Movement/shaking while recording
  * GPS-Signal Stregth
  * Weather conditions
  * Non-related/unwanted sounds (partial)

##Additional considered features
* Audio sequence vs accelerometer data analysis - more precise detection of movement influences
* Short instructional video demonstration
